                amount of sunlight that reached the tea leaves which resulting a valued flavored tea that soon became specialty of Uji which then increasingly famous globally.
                Although, even if it's different than the one prepared by Eisai, he still get credits for bringing tea to Japan. He also wrote a book about Matcha Benefits and how to prepare
                the fragile baverages that's called "Kissa Yojoki 喫茶養生記- How to Stay Healthy by Drinking Tea in 1211" which considered as the oldest Tea Book in Japan.
